## v2.0 - Architecture Migration
*March 2026*

### What changed

The entire application was restructured from a monolithic ASP.NET MVC app into
two separate projects: a .NET Web API backend and a Next.js frontend.

**Backend**
- Replaced ASP.NET MVC + Razor Views with ASP.NET Core Web API
- Controllers now return JSON instead of rendered HTML
- Same EF Core + SQLite stack, same data model, same database file
- Namespace updated from `Tasklog` to `Tasklog.Api`

**Frontend**
- New Next.js 16 app (App Router) in `frontend/`
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Space Grotesk + DM Sans font pairing
- Client-side state management replaces server-side TempData flash messages
- Deadline colour coding: red (overdue), yellow (due within 3 days)

**Repository**
- `Tasklog/` (v1 MVC project) moved to `legacy/` during migration, then removed
- `backend/` and `frontend/` folders replace the single project layout
- `Tasklog.sln` removed

### What stayed the same

- All v1 features: create task, view list, view detail, delete task, optional deadline
- SQLite database - existing data preserved, no schema changes
- No new features added during migration (by design)

### Known issues at release

See GitHub issues [#1](https://github.com/hydraInsurgent/Tasklog/issues/1) through
[#6](https://github.com/hydraInsurgent/Tasklog/issues/6) for limitations identified
during code review.
